## Intro

The files in this repo are exploratory graphs of data from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a> of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years (2006 to 2010).

## Objectives

The data was filtered to only contain the first 3 days of February. For these 3 days, the goal is to create exploratory graphs containing the following:\
* A histogram of the Global Active Power 
* A line graph of the Global Active Power 
* A line graph of all 3 submetering values 
* A multiple base plot with 4 line graphs of Global Active Power, Voltage, 3 submetering values, and Global Reactive Power



Note: The instruction say to examine a "2-day period in February, 2007" but did not specify which days. Also, 3 of the 4  graphs that are to be reproduced showed 3 days instead of 2. So I chose to look at the first 3 days of Feb 2007.
